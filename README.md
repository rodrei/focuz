# Focuz


### Browse with intention. Stay focused.

Focuz is a Chrome extension built to protect your attention.

The internet is incredible at keeping us connected—but it’s just as good at pulling us off course. Social feeds, addictive sites, and constant temptation make it harder than ever to use our time online consciously. Focuz helps you regain control by reducing unnecessary distractions, so your browsing supports your goals instead of hijacking them.

### Why choose Focuz?

Focuz reshapes your online environment to work for you. It quietly removes frictionless distractions while leaving important content within reach—helping you avoid mindless clicks, endless scrolling, and digital fatigue. More clarity, less noise.

### Features

- Block distracting sites with a gentle pause before you continue. When you try to open a blocked site, Focuz pauses you with a brief breathing prompt. After the prompt, you can either keep the site blocked or allow access for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. If you choose a timer, a small countdown appears so you can see how much time remains, and once the timer ends the site is blocked again automatically.

- Hide the YouTube home feed when you want a quieter start.
